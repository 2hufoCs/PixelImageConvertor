 Given an image, change its width and height as the user wants

All you have to do is to copy-paste the image you like in the "Resources" folder. Run the program and click the "Select Image..." button to choose it.
If you have any problems, either contact me on discord or just open a new issue, I'll do my best to answer your questions!
